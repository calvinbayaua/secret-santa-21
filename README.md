The start of the program shows a loading screen. The load time is indicated by a progress bar. However it is purely aesthetic and can be modified in the inspector.

When the load time finishes, the scene changes to a Windows '98 themed desktop. The scene has a clock that displays your system time and an "E-MAIL" button. Clicking the button will change to the next scene which is modeled after Microsoft Outlook. The text appears character by character. Scrolling to the bottom of the text area presents another button that changes to the last scene.

The last scene is a Windows Media Player that has 4 buttons. The play button plays an audio file and gradually displays an image. The pause button pauses the audio recording but continues to show the image. The replay button plays the audio recording back from the beginning. Finally, the download button opens an external link to which you can download both the audio recording and image.
